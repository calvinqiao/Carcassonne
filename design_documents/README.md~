How to play the game?

1. Method one: maually construct a game
- Create a board 
  Board board = new Board();

- Create a deck
  Deck deck = new Deck();
  deck.generateTileDeck();
  deck.shuffle();

- Create a tile
  - Load a tile
    Tile tile = new Tile("src/main/resources/tileA.json");
  - Or draw a tile from deck
    deck.drawTile();

- Create a player
  Player newPlayer = new Player(board, "player name");

- Place a tile
  tilePosition = new PositionOnBoard();
  tilePosition.setX(10); tilePosition.setY(9); tile.setTilePosition(tilePosition);
  board.placeTile(tile, 0);  // The second argument is the rotation degree angle, which is from 0 to 360.

- Place meeples
  board.PlaceMeeples(Player, int: number of meeples, Segment: tile segment to place the meeples);

- Update players' scores
  board.updatePlayerScores(boolean: isGameOver);


2. Method two: simulate a game with two players and comppletely random tile placement
- Use GameManager
  GameManager gameManager = new GameManager();
  gameManager.startGame();
